# Longest-Palindrome-subsequence-Dynamic-Programing
The program finds the length of the longest palindrome sub-sequence string from a given string of numbers given by the user.
It does so by using dynamic programming table that is filled with a recursive formula so we dont calculate values more than one time.

# Output
* Dynamic programing table
* The length is at the top right corner of the table
* The palindrome (printed below)

# Example
